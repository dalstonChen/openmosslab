## Graduate Admissions at OpenMoss Lab (Updated August 2025)

### Target Applicants:

We primarily recruit students who are passionate about scientific research and practical applications in large-scale AI. Ideal candidates are curious, proactive, dedicated to research or development, hardworking, and resilient. Students who are only seeking a degree for convenience or easier job placement should not apply.

In 2025, our main recruitment areas include large model pretraining, AI infrastructure, new architectures, multimodal fusion, agents, and embodied intelligence. Interested students are welcome to contact us.

### Important Notes:

**(a) Internships:** Except for project collaboration recommendations, students are not allowed to participate in any form of internship before Year 3 of the master's program or Year 5 of the PhD. Students planning early internships should not apply.

**(b) Engineering Tasks:** Graduate students in our lab are expected to participate in engineering tasks as needed. Those unwilling to engage in such work should not apply.

### Admissions Overview:

#### Master's Program:
Number of positions depends on research funding. In the past three years: 1 academic master, 1–2 recommended professional masters, ~10 exam-admitted professional masters per year.

In daily research, we do not differentiate between academic and professional masters, and all have the opportunity to transfer to the PhD program.

#### PhD Program:
Number of positions depends on research funding. In the past three years: 2–3 PhD positions per year.

We also recruit direct-PhD students at Shanghai Chuangzhi Institute, jointly trained with Fudan University, with no limit on positions. In addition to passing the Fudan interview, applicants must pass the Shanghai Chuangzhi Institute admission exam. It is recommended to secure a Shanghai Chuangzhi Institute offer before applying to the Fudan Summer Camp.

### Application Channels:

**(a) Summer Camp:** Must first pass the school-level preliminary review. Upon receiving the camp invitation, contact me (other inquiries can also be sent directly). We will arrange a short lab-level interview. In previous years, the success rate for academic masters through summer camp was ~10%. Our lab usually admits 2–3 students (academic + professional masters).

**(b) Autumn Recommended Admission:** Must first pass the school-level preliminary review. Upon receiving the interview notice, contact me. A lab-level interview will be arranged. Typically, if positions are filled during summer camp, no further recruitment occurs in this round.

**(c) Regular Graduate Exam Admission:** Contact me after receiving the Fudan University re-examination notice. A lab-level interview will be arranged.

### Lab-Level Interview:
- Usually conducted before the school interview
- Focus is on research potential, engineering ability, personality, and teamwork
- Students who complete nlp-beginner with high quality are prioritized
- We especially welcome students interested in AI algorithm deployment and system implementation with a dedicated research mindset

### Early Lab Entry:
- To help students secure suitable positions, we encourage students to start internships after Year 2
- Year 1 courses are heavy, leaving limited time for research output, so we prefer students to join the lab early
- External recommended students are encouraged to conduct their graduation project at Fudan (most previous students have done so)
- Based on performance, students may be selected for internships at ByteDance, Huawei, Shanghai AI Lab, Meituan, etc. (all previous interns have received full-time offers)

### Graduate Support:
- To provide a supportive learning and research environment, the lab offers competitive stipends in addition to school subsidies, aligned with other top research units
- Professional masters may receive housing subsidies
- Students participating in industry collaboration projects receive additional research allowances
