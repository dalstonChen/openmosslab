- Ability to document work clearly (e.g., using Feishu Docs or Markdown) to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing
- We recommend a document-style CV that highlights substance over design

### üîπ Research or Programming Foundations

We welcome students from diverse backgrounds, but candidates with prior experience will be given priority. Some examples of valuable skills:

**Programming foundations (any of the following is a plus):**
- Deep understanding of the Transformer architecture
- Participation in programming or algorithm competitions (NOIP, NOI, ACM, etc.)
- Core contributions to open-source projects
- Experience with large-scale parallel computing or system operations

**Research foundations (any of the following is a plus):**
- Proficiency with PyTorch or similar frameworks for training neural networks
- Familiarity with LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, DeepSeek) and some prompt engineering experience
- Strong English reading ability for academic papers, and solid skills in literature search and information gathering
- Prior experience with paper submission (authorship not required)
- Previous involvement in research projects (able to clearly explain your role and contributions)

### üîπ Exceptional Ability to Learn New Knowledge

**(If you demonstrate this, other requirements can be secondary!)**

- A genuine passion for continuous learning and research
- Ability to quickly grasp new concepts and connect them to broader ideas (you should be able to demonstrate this in interviews)
