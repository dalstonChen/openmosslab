🧪 About the OpenMoss Lab
The OpenMoss Lab, led by Prof. Xipeng Qiu at Fudan University, originated as part of the FudanNLP group, with a strong foundation in Natural Language Processing. Over time, the lab has significantly broadened its scope, now encompassing large language models, multimodal learning, embodied AI, and beyond. 
Our mission is to advance the theory, methods, and applications of large-scale AI systems—from pretraining and reasoning to multimodal and embodied intelligence—while grounding our research in real-world applications and products that make a lasting impact.
Achievements
Pioneering LLM development in China: Released MOSS, one of the earliest open-source conversational LLMs in China.
Influential open-source contributions: Developed widely adopted NLP toolkits such as FudanNLP, FastNLP, and the CoLLiE framework for efficient LLM fine-tuning.
Strong industry collaborations: Joint projects with Huawei, Honor, ByteDance, and other leading companies in large-scale model training and deployment.
Global recognition: Lab alumni have continued their studies at top universities, including MIT, UC Berkeley, and CMU, or joined leading companies such as ByteDance, Alibaba, AWS, Optiver, and other top quant firms.
Academic excellence: Publications at top-tier venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and ICCV, with several receiving Outstanding Paper Awards.
Talent cultivation: Multiple PhD graduates have secured faculty positions at Fudan University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and Shanghai AI Lab, or been selected as national-level young talents. Others have become entrepreneurs and executives (CEO/CTO) in LLM startups.

Graduate Admissions at CoIN Lab (Updated August 2025)
Target Applicants:
We primarily recruit students who are passionate about scientific research and practical applications in large-scale AI. Ideal candidates are curious, proactive, dedicated to research or development, hardworking, and resilient. Students who are only seeking a degree for convenience or easier job placement should not apply.
In 2025, our main recruitment areas include large model pretraining, AI infrastructure, new architectures, multimodal fusion, agents, and embodied intelligence. Interested students are welcome to contact us.
Important Notes:
(a) Internships: Except for project collaboration recommendations, students are not allowed to participate in any form of internship before Year 3 of the master’s program or Year 5 of the PhD. Students planning early internships should not apply.
(b) Engineering Tasks: Graduate students in our lab are expected to participate in engineering tasks as needed. Those unwilling to engage in such work should not apply.
Admissions Overview:
Master’s Program:
Number of positions depends on research funding. In the past three years: 1 academic master, 1–2 recommended professional masters, ~10 exam-admitted professional masters per year.
In daily research, we do not differentiate between academic and professional masters, and all have the opportunity to transfer to the PhD program.
PhD Program:
Number of positions depends on research funding. In the past three years: 2–3 PhD positions per year.
I also recruit direct-PhD students at Shanghai Chuangzhi Institute, jointly trained with Fudan University, with no limit on positions. In addition to passing the Fudan interview, applicants must pass the Shanghai Chuangzhi Institute admission exam. It is recommended to secure a Shanghai Chuangzhi Institute offer before applying to the Fudan Summer Camp.
Application Channels:
 (a) Summer Camp: Must first pass the school-level preliminary review. Upon receiving the camp invitation, contact me (other inquiries can also be sent directly). We will arrange a short lab-level interview. In previous years, the success rate for academic masters through summer camp was ~10%. Our lab usually admits 2–3 students (academic + professional masters).
 (b) Autumn Recommended Admission: Must first pass the school-level preliminary review. Upon receiving the interview notice, contact me. A lab-level interview will be arranged. Typically, if positions are filled during summer camp, no further recruitment occurs in this round.
 (c) Regular Graduate Exam Admission: Contact me after receiving the Fudan University re-examination notice. A lab-level interview will be arranged.
Lab-Level Interview:
Usually conducted before the school interview.
Focus is on research potential, engineering ability, personality, and teamwork.
Students who complete nlp-beginner with high quality are prioritized.
We especially welcome students interested in AI algorithm deployment and system implementation with a dedicated research mindset.
Early Lab Entry:
To help students secure suitable positions, we encourage students to start internships after Year 2.
Year 1 courses are heavy, leaving limited time for research output, so we prefer students to join the lab early.
External recommended students are encouraged to conduct their graduation project at Fudan (most previous students have done so).
Based on performance, students may be selected for internships at ByteDance, Huawei, Shanghai AI Lab, Meituan, etc. (all previous interns have received full-time offers).
Graduate Support:
To provide a supportive learning and research environment, the lab offers competitive stipends in addition to school subsidies, aligned with other top research units.
Professional masters may receive housing subsidies.
Students participating in industry collaboration projects receive additional research allowances.
